			Important to note;

- Ricat Management is a fictional company I made up.

- The data set used are in two seperate excel file, they are in this repository. 

			My Analysis;

 - Generally, there are two genders in the organization. However, some employees
   did not disclose their gender, therefore I named them 'unspecified'.

- I started with visualizing the gender distribution in the organization, distilled to regions and departments

- I showed insights on ratings based on gender

- Then I went on to analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. 

  Thereafter, I identified the department and regions that should be the focus of the company's management

- I assumed a regulation made it mandatory for  manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of
  $90,000, therefore;

  I checked if  Ricart met this requirement. 

- Furthermore, I showed pay distribution of employees, grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees falls into a band of
  $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000 etc. this was visualize by regions

- I calculated the amount to be paid as bonus to individual employees using the percentatges provided per department

- Also, amount to be paid to individual employees, salary inclusive of bonus

- Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
